NAME
    Class::DBI::DATA::Schema - Execute Class::DBI SQL from DATA sections

SYNOPSIS
      package Film.pm;
      use base 'Class::DBI';
              # ... normal Class::DBI setup

      use 'Class::DBI::DATA::Schema';

      Film->run_data_sql;

            __DATA__
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS film (....);
            REPLACE INTO film VALUES (...);
            REPLACE INTO film VALUES (...);

DESCRIPTION
    This is an extension to Class::DBI which injects a method into your
    class to find and execute all SQL statements in the DATA section of the
    package.

METHODS
  run_data_sql
      Film->run_data_sql;

    Using this module will export a run_data_sql method into your class.
    This method will find SQL statements in the DATA section of the class it
    is called from, and execute them against the database that that class is
    set up to use.

    It is safe to import this method into a Class::DBI subclass being used
    as the superclass for a range of classes.

    WARNING: this does not do anything fancy to work out what is SQL. It
    merely assumes that everything in the DATA section is SQL, and applies
    each thing it finds (separated by semi-colons) in turn to your database.
    Similarly there is no security checking, or validation of the DATA in
    any way.

TRANSLATION and CACHING
    There are undocumented arguments that will allow this module to
    translate the SQL from one database schema to another, and also to cache
    the result of that translation. People are relying on these, so they're
    not going to go away, but you're going to need to read the source to
    work out how to use them.
